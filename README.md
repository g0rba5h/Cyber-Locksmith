Cyber Locksmith CTF Scripts

Welcome to my Cyber Locksmith CTF Scripts repository.

What's Inside?

    password_generator.py: Crafts potential keys based on 'Alpha-Zero's encryption strategy.

    brute.py: Tests these keys to unlock an encrypted file from the challenge.

    decrypt.py: Can be used against single encrypted files.

Disclaimer

These scripts were custom-built for the Cyber Locksmith CTF. They might not crack other encryption puzzles the same way.

What You'll Find

    password_generator.py
    brute.py
